# JIRA PS Ticket Process Bot - Development Tasks

This document contains all the development tasks extracted from the development plan, organized by phases for systematic implementation.

## Phase 0: Planning & Setup (1 week)
**Objective:** Establish foundational elements and prepare the development environment.

### 0.1 Project Kick-off & Stakeholder Alignment
- [x] Confirm PRD and TDD with all stakeholders
- [x] Define concrete JIRA project(s) and issue types for bot operation
- [x] Finalize specific JIRA status transitions (e.g., "In Progress" ID, "Awaiting Customer Info" ID)

### 0.2 JIRA API Access & Permissions
- [x] Obtain or create a dedicated JIRA user/API token for the bot
- [x] Ensure necessary permissions are granted (read issues, add comments, transition issues in target projects)
- [x] Set up JIRA webhooks for issue creation/update events (if using webhooks)

### 0.3 LLM API Access
- [x] Obtain API key for Google Gemini API
- [x] Understand rate limits and quotas

### 0.4 Environment Setup
- [x] Set up development, staging, and production environments
- [x] Configure version control repository (Git)
- [x] Establish CI/CD pipeline basics (e.g., automated linting, basic build checks)

### 0.5 Initial Configuration Definition
- [x] Define initial configurable parameters (e.g., quality rule thresholds, JIRA field mappings, transition mappings) in a configuration file/structure

## Phase 1: Core Bot Development (MVP) (3-4 weeks)
**Objective:** Develop the core functionalities of the bot as defined in the PRD and TDD, focusing on a Minimum Viable Product (MVP).

### 1.1 JIRA Integration Module - Ingestion (Webhook Listener/Polling)
- [x] Develop webhook listener endpoint or polling mechanism
- [x] Implement JIRA REST API calls to fetch full ticket details (GET /issue/{issueIdOrKey})
- [x] Parse JIRA JSON response and map to internal data structures
- [x] Implement basic error handling for API calls

### 1.2 Ticket Queue Implementation
- [x] Set up the chosen message queue (e.g., Redis, SQS, Pub/Sub)
- [x] Implement logic to push raw ticket data onto the queue
- [x] Develop a Worker Process to consume messages from the queue

### 1.3 Quality Assessment Engine
- [x] Implement initial set of quality rules (summary length, description length, steps to reproduce, affected version, attachments for bugs, high priority check)
- [x] Develop logic to determine "Overall Quality" and "Issues Found"
- [x] Make rule parameters configurable (from Phase 0.5)

### 1.4 AI Comment Generation Module
- [x] Implement logic to construct the prompt for the Gemini API, incorporating ticket details and quality assessment
- [x] Integrate with Google Gemini API to send requests and receive responses
- [x] Implement basic error handling for AI API calls

### 1.5 JIRA Integration Module - Data Sending (Commenting)
- [x] Implement JIRA REST API call to add comments (POST /issue/{issueIdOrKey}/comment)

### 1.6 Initial Logging
- [ ] Implement basic logging for each module's key operations (e.g., ticket received, quality assessed, comment generated)

## Phase 2: Enhancement & Robustness (2-3 weeks)
**Objective:** Enhance the bot with improved error handling, notifications, and full ticket transition capabilities.

### 2.1 JIRA Integration Module - Data Sending (Transition)
- [ ] Implement JIRA REST API call to transition tickets (POST /issue/{issueIdOrKey}/transitions)
- [ ] Ensure correct transitionId mapping based on target status

### 2.2 Ticket Transition Module
- [ ] Implement the logic to map "Overall Quality" to specific JIRA target statuses
- [ ] Utilize configurable transition rules

### 2.3 Advanced Error Handling & Retries
- [ ] Implement exponential backoff for transient API errors (JIRA, AI)
- [ ] Refine error classification (transient vs. permanent)
- [ ] Implement dead-letter queue for failed messages (if using a robust queue)

### 2.4 Notification System
- [ ] Integrate with a designated support channel (e.g., Slack, email) for critical error notifications
- [ ] Define notification triggers (e.g., persistent processing failures, unhandled exceptions)

### 2.5 Security Best Practices
- [ ] Implement secure handling of API keys (environment variables, secrets manager)
- [ ] Ensure all API communication uses HTTPS
- [ ] Basic input validation/sanitization for extracted JIRA data

### 2.6 Code Refactoring & Documentation
- [ ] Refactor code for modularity and readability
- [ ] Add comprehensive inline comments and module-level documentation
- [ ] Update configuration instructions

## Phase 3: Testing & Deployment (1-2 weeks)
**Objective:** Ensure the bot is stable, functional, and ready for production deployment.

### 3.1 Unit Testing
- [ ] Write and execute unit tests for each module (JIRA integration, quality assessment, AI comment generation, transition logic)

### 3.2 Integration Testing
- [ ] Test the end-to-end flow in a staging JIRA environment
- [ ] Verify correct data extraction, quality assessment, comment generation, and status transitions
- [ ] Test error handling and notification mechanisms

### 3.3 Performance Testing (Basic)
- [ ] Simulate a reasonable volume of tickets to ensure the "less than 30 seconds per ticket" performance metric is met

### 3.4 Security Audit (Basic)
- [ ] Review code for common security vulnerabilities (e.g., hardcoded credentials, injection risks)

### 3.5 Deployment Automation
- [ ] Finalize CI/CD pipeline for automated deployments to staging and production
- [ ] Prepare deployment scripts/configurations for the chosen hosting environment (serverless function, container)

### 3.6 User Acceptance Testing (UAT)
- [ ] Conduct UAT with Product Support team members on the staging environment
- [ ] Gather feedback and address any critical issues

## Phase 4: Post-Deployment & Iteration (Ongoing)
**Objective:** Monitor bot performance, gather feedback, and plan future enhancements.

### 4.1 Production Monitoring & Alerting
- [ ] Continuously monitor bot health, processing success rates, and error logs
- [ ] Respond to and resolve production incidents

### 4.2 Feedback Collection
- [ ] Regularly solicit feedback from Product Support agents and other stakeholders

### 4.3 Iteration Planning
- [ ] Review feedback and monitoring data
- [ ] Prioritize and plan for future enhancements (e.g., new quality rules, more advanced AI prompts, configurable rules UI, multi-language support, sentiment analysis, knowledge base suggestions)

### 4.4 AI Model Fine-tuning/Update
- [ ] As AI models evolve or new needs arise, plan for updating the AI integration and prompt engineering

## Resource Allocation
- **Backend Developer(s):** Responsible for JIRA integration, queueing, quality assessment, AI integration, transition logic, error handling, logging, and deployment
- **DevOps Engineer (Support):** Assist with CI/CD, infrastructure setup (serverless/containers), monitoring, and secrets management
- **QA Engineer:** Responsible for testing, test plan creation, and UAT coordination
- **Product Manager:** Define requirements, prioritize features, gather feedback, and manage the product roadmap

## Dependencies & Risks
- **JIRA API Stability & Access:** Reliance on JIRA's API availability and correct permissions
- **Gemini API Performance & Rate Limits:** Potential for delays or failures if API limits are hit
- **Accurate Prompt Engineering:** The quality of AI comments is heavily dependent on well-crafted prompts. Iteration and testing will be crucial
- **Configuration Management:** Ensuring rules and mappings are easily configurable and managed
- **Stakeholder Availability:** Timely feedback and approvals from JIRA administrators and support teams
