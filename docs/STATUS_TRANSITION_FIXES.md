# 🔧 Status Transition Fixes - PS-1762 Testing

## 📋 Issues Identified & Fixed

During PS-1762 testing, two critical issues were identified and successfully resolved:

### **Issue 1: Status Transitions Not Actually Executing** ❌ → ✅
**Problem**: The system was only suggesting status transitions, not actually changing the ticket status in JIRA.

**Root Cause**: The status automation code was not properly executing the JIRA REST API calls to perform transitions.

**Solution**: 
- Implemented working JIRA transition discovery and execution
- Added proper error handling and validation
- Verified transitions are actually applied to tickets

### **Issue 2: Status Transition Info in Comments** ❌ → ✅
**Problem**: Comments included technical status transition information that users don't need to see.

**Root Cause**: Comment generation was adding `**Status Transition:** [status]` lines to user-facing comments.

**Solution**:
- Removed status transition info from all comment generation
- Status transitions now happen silently in the background
- Comments focus purely on user guidance and next steps

## 🎯 PS-1762 Test Results
