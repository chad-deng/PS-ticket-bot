# üßπ Comment Conciseness Update: Remove Verbose Sections

## üìã Issue Identified & Fixed

During PS-1762 testing, verbose sections were identified in the AI-generated comments that made them unnecessarily long and detailed.

### **Issue: Verbose Comment Sections** ‚ùå ‚Üí ‚úÖ
**Problem**: Comments included verbose explanations that users don't need:
- "Why This Information Matters" with detailed explanations
- "Our Commitment" with timeline promises and process details

**Root Cause**: AI prompt templates were encouraging detailed explanations and process commitments.

**Solution**: 
- Updated AI prompt templates to emphasize conciseness
- Posted clean comment example without verbose sections
- Modified system prompts to avoid process explanations

## üßπ Sections Removed
